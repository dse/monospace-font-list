# monospace-font-list

## About

My goal is to create the most exhaustive list of monospace fonts I
can.  Primarily for the fun of it, but sometimes I like to use fonts
that are not focused on coding.

I've found a few lists here and there of coding-focused monospace
fonts, but none of them are exhaustive, and I also haven't seen any
lists that include fonts that are not necessarily focused on coding.
Namely, those inspired by or sourced from 20th-century typewriters.

Send an email to dsembry AT SIGN gmail PERIOD com if you know of any
I've missed.  Or submit a patch or pull request.

## Caveats

-   I'm not going to include "grungy" typewriter fonts.

## Other Lists of Fonts

These lists, for the most part, do not attempt to be comprehensive,
as this one does.

## Reddit Threads

I posted about this project in [r/typewriters](https://www.reddit.com/r/typewriters/comments/aw9qb2/im_working_on_a_list_of_typewriter_monospace/),
[r/fonts](https://www.reddit.com/r/fonts/comments/aw9cn2/im_working_on_a_list_of_monospace_fonts_crosspost/),
and
[r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/aw9cv9/im_working_on_a_list_of_monospace_fonts_crosspost/),
in case you're looking for additional insight.

Not much love except in r/fonts though.

## Old Typewriter Typefaces

I'm listing this as a separate section, as there are many minor
variations among vintage typewriter typefaces that have not been yet
computerized.
