## About

My goal is to create the most exhaustive list of monospace fonts I
can.  Primarily for the fun of it, but sometimes I like to use fonts
that are not focused on coding.

I've found a few lists here and there of coding-focused monospace
fonts, but none of them are exhaustive, and I also haven't seen any
lists that include fonts that are not necessarily focused on coding.
Namely, those inspired by or sourced from 20th-century typewriters.

I am [not including grungy fonts](./grungy.md).

Send an email to dsembry AT SIGN gmail PERIOD com if you know of any
I've missed.  Or submit a patch or pull request.

## Icon Fonts

Just in case you want some impossibly fancy shell prompts.

-   [Powerline Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) - for shell
    prompts and status lines

-   [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) - aggregates icon fonts
    like fontawesome
    -   NOTE: some fonts are renamed, possibly due to font name
        restrictions Ã  la Computer Modern Roman (i.e., Reserved Font
        Names)
