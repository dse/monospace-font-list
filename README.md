## About

My goal is to create the most exhaustive list of monospace fonts I
can.  Primarily for the fun of it, but sometimes I like to use fonts
that are not focused on coding.

I've found a few lists here and there of coding-focused monospace
fonts, but none of them are exhaustive, and I also haven't seen any
lists that include fonts that are not necessarily focused on coding.
Namely, those inspired by or sourced from 20th-century typewriters.

Send an email to dsembry AT SIGN gmail PERIOD com if you know of any
I've missed.  Or submit a patch or pull request.

## "Grungy" Fonts

I'm not going to list all of them here.

-   You've probably seen
    [Trixie](https://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/ff-trixie-hd/) because
    it is the grandaddy of "grungy" typewriter fonts.

-   [GNU Typewriter](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/gnutypewriter) is
    OFL-SIL-licensed.

-   [TT2020](https://copypaste.wtf/TT2020/docs/) has both clean and
    "grungy" variants, and is the most authentic in that each
    character has a few different "grungy" variants so all the E's,
    for example, don't look the same.
