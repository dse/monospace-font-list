# About "Grungy" Fonts

I'm not going to list all of them here.  The following are the three
most important ones.

-   [TT2020](https://copypaste.wtf/TT2020/docs/) has both clean and
    "grungy" variants.  The "grungy" variant is the most authentic in
    that each character has a few different variants so all the E's,
    for example, don't look the same.

-   You've probably seen
    [Trixie](https://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/ff-trixie-hd/) because
    it is the grandaddy of "grungy" typewriter fonts.

-   [GNU Typewriter](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/gnutypewriter) is
    OFL-SIL-licensed.
