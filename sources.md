## Reddit Threads

I posted about the monospace font list project in [r/typewriters](https://www.reddit.com/r/typewriters/comments/aw9qb2/im_working_on_a_list_of_typewriter_monospace/),
[r/fonts](https://www.reddit.com/r/fonts/comments/aw9cn2/im_working_on_a_list_of_monospace_fonts_crosspost/),
and
[r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/aw9cv9/im_working_on_a_list_of_monospace_fonts_crosspost/),
in case you're looking for additional insight.

Not much love except in r/fonts though.

computerized.
