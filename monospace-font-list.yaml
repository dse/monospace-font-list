    description: "64-SRC is a condensed monospace font inspired by 1960s IBM Selectric type seen on HAL’s telemetric displays in 2001: A Space Odyssey. It is characterized by unique \"double-space\" alternates for the widest characters such as “w” and “m”. These alternates maximize legibility, improve the rhythm of readability and keep typographic color even. As a result 64-SRC is as well suited for extensive copy as it is display type."

    description: "Fifteen years after its first release, Laurenz Brunner’s now famous LL Akkurat (2004) appears almost humble. With its static construction, it has proven that combining the qualities of classic sans-serif craft with a new contemporaneity can be a sustainable endeavour. Never attempting to be trendy, elegant or fashionable, LL Akkurat aspired to embody qualities such as technical precision, down-to-earth robustness, reliability and neutrality, reflecting certain values generally associated with Switzerland."

    notes: |
      Computer Modern was Donald Knuth\'s original name for his family
      of typefaces, including this monospace variant.  As a condition
      of his license, derivative works can not be called \"Computer
      Modern\".  Popular modern implementations of Computer Modern
      include:

      - the CMU distribution (for Computer Modern Unicode);

      - the PostScript Type 1 versions generated by Blue Sky, Inc. and
      donated to the American Mathematical Society; and

      - Latin Modern.

    notes: |
      Courier was commissioned by IBM to become a standard typewriter
      font for the typewriter industry.  As such, IBM deliberately did
      not seek intellectual property protection for it; it is royalty
      free.

      Implementations not specifically listed here include:
      - Adobe\'s bitmap version for X11
      - Microsoft\'s bitmap version for Windows
      - Linotype\'s square terminal version
      - Monotype\'s square terminal version
      - Adobe\'s square terminal version

      Since its release in 1956, Courier has become favored for
      screenplays and business correspondence, and a version of
      Courier is bundled with virtually all modern computer operating
      systems.

    notes: |
      In response to a few rather obvious examples of poor typewriter
      font realism in recent movies, Fredrick Brennan created TT2020.

      Styled after early 20th-century typewriter faces, TT2020
      includes a clean variant as well as a variety of distressed
      variants.  Each variant comes with nine slightly different
      variants of each character, from which one is pseudo-randomly
      chosen when rendered, adding a degree of realism not likely
      hithertofore seen in typewriter fonts.

      Another example of a typeface that pseudo-randomly chooses from
      a number of variants of each character is Neue, the corporate
      font used by The New School <https://www.newschool.edu/>.

      TT2020 includes upright and italic variants.
